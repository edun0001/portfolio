  During the creation of my TECHNIX web portfolio, I embarked on a methodical journey, starting with meticulous planning and wireframing to establish a coherent structure. Challenges emerged in the realm of responsive design, demanding an adept use of CSS Flexbox and Media Queries to conquer layout inconsistencies across diverse devices. Navigating the waters of JavaScript compatibility, I embraced browser-specific solutions to harmonize interactivity and scrolling behavior. Engrained in this process was a profound commitment to accessibility, as I undertook rigorous testing, fine-tuned contrast ratios, and embraced ARIA attributes to ensure inclusivity. Through this iterative process, I garnered an invaluable appreciation for the significance of planning, the mastery of responsive design, the pursuit of cross-browser compatibility, and the paramount importance of creating an accessible and user-centric digital space.
